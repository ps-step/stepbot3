                <h3>Edexcel A Level Maths</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.physicsandmathstutor.com/maths-revision/a-level-edexcel/papers/" target="_blank">Past paper spam</a> is the best way to revise maths. There are ridiculous amounts of past papers, both official ones and community ones. I’ve just attached the PMT page for Edexcel A Level Maths from 2017 onwards, but it’s so easy to find more if you run out. Do these in timed conditions whenever possible, then review your mistake using the mark scheme. Some more sources off the top of my head include <a href="https://crashmaths.com/" target="_blank">Crash Maths</a> and <a href="https://madasmaths.com/" target="_blank">Madas Maths</a> but as I said these are essentially endless.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NeilDoesMaths/videos" target="_blank">Neil Does Maths</a> is a bit of a niche Youtube channel, but it’s essentially just a bloke going through past paper questions. This could be good if you want to use past paper questions but struggle to understand markschemes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The A Level Maths <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Hzr2FEogvSjSFjU3_il3JyMbvj0X4m7m" target="_blank">textbooks</a> are pretty good. Unlike other subjects, you can actually use them to learn the subject. I find that the questions at the back of each chapter are okay, but it might just be better to use past paper questions, since these can be too easy, too hard, or just unrealistic questions. Also note there are occasional mistakes in the textbooks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@petehartmaths" target="_blank">Pete Hart</a> has made videos going through all the exercises for the textbooks which are a good accompaniment to the textbooks. He’s also a great guy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg2tfDG3Ww4vrstKAZ0dajHx_hq85P0G-" target="_blank">TLMaths</a> is a Youtube channel which has a playlist teaching everything in A Level Maths with example questions and such. If you needed to learn a topic as fast as possible this would be the best way; there are not as many details as other channels and past paper questions are not used, but it is completely comprehensive. You may wish to use his spreadsheet to find out which videos are relevant for your exam board.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BicenMaths/videos" target="_blank">Bicen Maths</a> is probably the most popular maths Youtube channel for good reason, it covers pretty much everything in great detail; his stuff is probably the best way to learn from videos.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@adamsmaths" target="_blank">Haberdashers' Adams Maths Department</a> is another channel which seems to have gone through the whole course. I have not watched their videos and they look a bit more like the 2010 style of teaching videos - not that this is necessarily a bad thing. It’s an option!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://madasmaths.com/" target="_blank">Madas Maths</a> focuses more on the resources available on their website than their Youtube channel, but both are available. I have not used Madas much personally, however I hear great things about their custom papers, particularly if aiming for top grades. They also appear to have comprehensive powerpoints for teaching the whole course.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Similarly, <a href="https://www.drfrost.org/" target="_blank">Dr. Frost</a> has powerpoints going through everything in the course, which are especially useful for mechanics in my experience. You could absolutely teach yourself the course through Dr. Frost’s resources in my experience.

                <h3>Edexcel A Level Further Maths</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.physicsandmathstutor.com/maths-revision/a-level-edexcel/papers-further/" target="_blank">Past paper spam</a> again will be the best way to revise. I’ve only attached the PMT link but there are heaps of further maths papers available if you go looking. It might be a good shout to make a spreadsheet of which ones you have completed. Just as for normal maths, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NeilDoesMaths/videos" target="_blank">Neil Does Maths</a> has some good videos going through some exam questions but there are much fewer of these than for normal maths.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Regarding <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17ikD-5swJ7qz5ueD64T10sy3gXmOpcMR" target="_blank">textbooks</a>, it’s again exactly the same things to say as the normal A Level Maths textbooks. Note that I only have PDFs for the core pure textbooks as well as Further Mechanics 1 and Further Stats 1.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg2tfDG3Ww4vrstKAZ0dajHx_hq85P0G-" target="_blank">TLMaths</a> has not quite completed his videos for all of further maths - I think that’s a work in progress?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BicenMaths/videos" target="_blank">Bicen Maths</a> probably has completed the course knowing the amount of videos on there but I haven’t personally used it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        As for other channels teaching the whole course, there is also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@fmvideos3803" target="_blank">FM Videos</a> which is one of those channels which is a bit more 2010 style, but it’s probably still fine. Having a quick look, it really seems they have stuff for like every exam board which is lovely and whimsical.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://madasmaths.com/" target="_blank">Madas Maths</a> does have some stuff for further, but I don’t think it’s as complete as for the normal spec.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        As for <a href="https://www.drfrost.org/" target="_blank">Dr. Frost</a>, I have only used his resources for mechanics when it comes to further maths, but they were very useful in that case.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>TMUA, MAT, Senior Maths Challenge, and Senior Kangaroo</h3>
                <p><em>(note: did not take MAT)</em></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@rtwodrew2" target="_blank">R2Drew2</a> is the goat for TMUA - he has videos going through every past paper including essentially every community past paper. He also has similarly exquisite videos for many senior maths challenge papers and some senior kangaroo ones. He also has some videos going through stuff which is unique to the TMUA specification or which you might not have considered in quite a while, such as quadrilaterals.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        As for <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_YE23yIx8MHJws5AXrwWXORkdeSbv74y" target="_blank">TMUA past papers</a>, you should be aiming to do all of them at least once - there’s really not that many official ones, and given that it is the most important part of your application for many universities you really should put in the work. Please note that older papers are much easier!! Do not think you are chilling if you get an 8.0 or something on the 2017 paper, because you may be humbled by newer papers. Then, once you have done all of the existing past papers, you have probably done enough.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        But if you really want to go for a great grade, then you may wish to do some of the many <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_YE23yIx8MHJws5AXrwWXORkdeSbv74y" target="_blank">TMUA community past papers</a>; these are just unofficial TMUA mock papers. I should comment on the difficulty of some of these:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The papers by <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_YE23yIx8MHJws5AXrwWXORkdeSbv74y" target="_blank">Tyler Tutoring</a>, which are four of each, are probably slightly easier than the real paper.</li>
                            <li>The papers by <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_YE23yIx8MHJws5AXrwWXORkdeSbv74y" target="_blank">Yotta</a> are absolutely diabolical and they will humble you. They are meant to be harder than a real paper.</li>
                            <li>The papers by <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_YE23yIx8MHJws5AXrwWXORkdeSbv74y" target="_blank">James</a> are quite a bit easier than the real TMUA - I don’t think they’re worth spending too much time on.</li>
                            <li>The papers by <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_YE23yIx8MHJws5AXrwWXORkdeSbv74y" target="_blank">Asher Falcon</a> are also quite a bit easier.</li>
                            <li>The papers by <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_YE23yIx8MHJws5AXrwWXORkdeSbv74y" target="_blank">Beyond Horizon</a> are probably a touch harder than the real paper.</li>
                            <li>I haven’t done the papers by <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_YE23yIx8MHJws5AXrwWXORkdeSbv74y" target="_blank">Zetta</a> or <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_YE23yIx8MHJws5AXrwWXORkdeSbv74y" target="_blank">Oxbridge Applications</a> so can’t really comment on their difficulty.</li>
                            <li>There is also a <a href="https://mega.nz/folder/S8FjEKZS#n8zVDbfRz3PJs-dx-w-CGg" target="_blank">MEGA folder with two papers by STEPMaths</a> which I couldn’t be bothered to add to Google Drive.</li>
                            <li>There is also a <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_YE23yIx8MHJws5AXrwWXORkdeSbv74y" target="_blank">2024 Chinese TMUA Paper</a> which consists of questions recalled by students after the 2024 exam.</li>

I don’t think it’s that exceptional, especially for TMUA, but some have had a good experience with it.

                <h3>BMO</h3>
                <p><em>(note: flopped this lol)</em></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://ukmt.org.uk/competition-papers/jsf/jet-engine:free-past-papers/tax/challenge-type:78/" target="_blank">Past paper spam</a> is the best way to go, but then again the papers are three and a half hours so this is quite difficult! Like STEP, the longer nature of the questions might be more suited to doing one or two questions at a time and maybe leaving a paper or two for the last days before the exam. However, remember that qualifying to BMO2 is very hard! It might be worth revising other, more relevant areas rather than BMO1 unless you are already close to the boundary for BMO2.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In this case though, there are also literal decades of BMO1 and BMO2 questions with <a href="https://bmos.ukmt.org.uk/solutions/" target="_blank">video solutions</a> on the UKMT website.

                        If somehow you do run out or something, then essentially any Olympiad questions or papers from any country will also be fine. You may wish to find examples of these from channels like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MichaelPennMath" target="_blank">Michael Penn</a> who often cover Olympiad problems.

                <h3>Oxbridge Interviews</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uM6opndumH_1-18XYoKp9gcAWgcGcHs7" target="_blank">Google Drive</a> contains absolutely every mock interview and past interview question you will need. Due to the nature of interviews, there are no official past papers or anything, but there are many community made mock interview resources, which are compiled in the Google Drive. My strategy was to print out all of the following and keep them in a folder so that I could gradually chip away at the questions and make some tangible progress. Out of these, the following were the most useful to me:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The <strong>Oxford interview questionnaires</strong>, handwritten notes compiled by people immediately after their interviews, and sheets with headings like ‘Interview 1’ and ‘Interview 2’ are, as the name suggests, peoples’ actual interview questions - therefore, you should do them!</li>
                            <li>The <strong>Jesus College Specimen Admissions Test</strong> is meant to be more of a pre-interview admissions test, which is what some colleges do rather than just chucking you straight into an interview, but this is essentially interview questions so is also useful.</li>
                            <li>I can’t remember who they’re by, but the sheets with stuff which looks like essentially STEP questions with summations and integrals were very good, and much more like interview questions than they look.</li>
                            <li>The following problem sheets were all very good in terms of difficulty:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>‘Problem Sheet - Oxbridge Maths Interview Questions’</strong> by Isaac Tseng</li>

Still, his answers are all good for the questions which remain in the Google doc.

                        One of the most important things to utilise for interview prep is Youtube mock interviews. Examples include:
                        <ul>

                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Lastly, each year the STEP Support Programme runs some <a href="https://step.maths.org/webinars" target="_blank">interview webinars</a> in the months before interviews - these include general tips and advice for interviews and some walkthrough interview problems with current students. They are overall okay but not an incredible use of time. Old webinars are sometimes available and sometimes down.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There are some <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MjMGPhCM4V9yoQcZEZX41M1qxPwJB6lG" target="_blank">reading lists</a> out there for what to put on your personal statement. This doesn’t matter too much though.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://vg354.user.srcf.net/index.html" target="_blank">Vishal Gupta’s website</a> has some good advice for interviews.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Try your best to get some mock interviews from teachers or professors. Many will be happy to help out!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The <a href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/study-here/undergraduate-study/maths-admissions-test/mat-livestream" target="_blank">MAT livestreams</a> do some past interview questions in the run-up to interview time - of course, there cannot be many of these by the nature of the weekly livestream format so I recommend having a look at some older ones.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.drfrost.org/page.php?id=6" target="_blank">Dr. Frost’s ‘Zeta Club’</a> features some problems which could probably be discussed in an interview.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The <a href="https://dailyintegral.com/" target="_blank">daily integral website</a> gives you four integrals each day to solve - do not attempt hard difficulty, you will be humbled! But easy and medium difficulty integrals could plausibly be in an interview. Similarly, blackpenredpen’s <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/615817072/100-Integrals" target="_blank">100 Integrals 1</a> and <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/620102760/100-Integrals-Part-2" target="_blank">100 Integrals 2</a> might be worthwhile for preparing for integration in interviews, but many of them are a little simple for an interview.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>AEA</h3>
                <p><em>(not actual AEA revision unfortunately)</em></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I don’t know how to revise for AEA except the obvious <a href="https://www.fredandamysmathsshack.com/al/aea/aea.html" target="_blank">past papers</a>, since I do not take it, but I include it here as AEA uses the same spec as normal maths but just has more difficult questions, which is similar to what STEP does for further maths - so, it might be useful for STEP preparation?
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>STEP</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The <a href="https://step.maths.org/" target="_blank">STEP support programme</a> has modules to help students prepare from STEP, building up from A Level Maths. I haven’t used it too much but I’ve heard great things, and it seems to be the best way to bridge the gap from A Level to STEP.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Using <a href="https://www.physicsandmathstutor.com/admissions/step/" target="_blank">past papers</a> is a little bit more difficult for STEP than other exams as it is three hours, so doing past papers in timed conditions is quite hard to do efficiently. Therefore, consider using the <a href="https://stepdatabase.maths.org/database/index.html" target="_blank">STEP question bank</a> website to do individual questions at a time, though do consider leaving a few papers for timed conditions near the time of the exam.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There are a few community papers for STEP, namely a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UOernQWPTAA2equ3GW9zBhC7ljZfNYq9/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">mock paper</a> and a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kOT3ckMCOWVFTS0CqkZk2NmefJ2x7zOR/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">‘STEP 4’ paper</a>, which is supposed to be a little harder than STEP 3, but in my experience is of similar difficulty.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Finally, you may choose to use the solutions from <a href="https://integralmaths.org/" target="_blank">Integral Maths</a> which are more detailed than official solutions. To login, use the username mei- stepaea and the password Stepaea1.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The <a href="https://books.openbookpublishers.com/10.11647/obp.0181.pdf" target="_blank">Siklos</a> book is more suited to STEP than other exams like TMUA, but in my opinion it’s more worth it to just use the STEP Support Programme.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Similarly, the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G-UX5prpAumJvq5JryrczBMcQQMK__0m/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">STEP, MAT, TMUA textbook</a>… exists - I really don’t see the point though.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://vg354.user.srcf.net/index.html" target="_blank">Vishal Gupta’s website</a> has some good advice for STEP.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        As for Youtube channels which are not specifically for STEP but which may be useful, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@maths_505" target="_blank">Maths 505</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MichaelPennMath" target="_blank">Michael Penn</a> could help with the harder integration questions in STEP. However, they are both definitely not aimed at the knowledge of STEP students and thus some of their videos may be inaccessible, such as using contour integration.
